1.
[5] 
The ciphertext 
“
Y
XCYIS
” 
was 
produced
by an affine cipher mod 26.  
You have 
reason to believe
plaintext starts
with
“cr
”
.  
a.
What’s the key?
b.
D
ecrypt the entire message
.  
c.
What kind of 
attack is this?
2.

Suppose we encrypt a message with an affine cipher using key K1, then encrypt 
the ciphertext with an affine cipher using key K2.  Is this double encryption more 
secure than just doing a single encryption?
Support your answer mathematically. 
3.
[5] 
Suppose 
our alphabet has only 3 letters, A, B, and C, which occu
r in plaintext 
with frequency 7
5
%, 
15
%, 1
0
%, respectively.  A message is encrypted with a 
Vigenère 
cipher (mod 3, of course), using a key that is of length 1, 2, or 3 (you don’t 
know which).  I
f the c
iphertext is CBCABAAACA.
a.
W
hat is the most likely key length?  Why?
b.
What is the likely key?
4.
[5] A friend c
laims the following:  The Vigenè
re cipher can be made stronger against 
cryptanalysis if one uses multiple rounds.  That is, if a plaintext is 
encrypted with the 
Vigen
è
re cipher with a key of length 
m
, and the resulting ciphertext is again 
encrypted with the Vigen
è
re cipher with a key of length 
n
, then the net effect is the 
same as encryption with the Vigen
è
re cipher with a longer key of length 
m
∙n
.  In 
particular, your friend claims this is true only when 
m
and 
n
are relatively prime.  
a.
Is your friend correct?

Let 
E
1
and E
2
be two independent tosses of a f
air coin.  Find the entropy H(E
1
) 
and joint entropy H(E
1
,E
2
).  Why i
s H(
E
1
,E
2
)=H(
E
1
)+H(
E

)?

Can you change the experiment in 5
(above)
so that H(
E
1
,E
2
) < H(
E
1
)+H(
E

) ?  Can 
you change it so H(
E

,E

) > H(
E

)+H(
E

) ?

Let X be
a random variable that takes on integer values.  The probability is ½ that 
X will be in the range [0,2
7
-
1] with all values in that range being equally likely.  The 
rest of the time, it will be in the range [2
7
,2
14
-
1], again with uniform probability.  
What
is the entropy H(X)?
(Estimation is OK).

A bag contains 
6
red balls, 
2
white 
balls, and 2 black balls.  
a.
You 
choose 2 balls from the bag with replacement (i.e. you put the first ball 
back in and shake before drawing the second).  
What is the entropy
of the 
experi
ment?
b.
You 
choose 2 balls from the bag without replacement (i.e. you keep the first 
b
all while drawing the second).  How is your uncertainty affected 
now that 
you know the color of
the first ball before drawing the second?
What is the 
entropy
of this new experiment given the first ball you choose is red?

Write a small program that loads in a text file of any size and then prints the 
frequency (as a percentage) of each character (‘a’..’z’)
.  All characters should be made 
lowercase for co
unting purposes.  Ignore punctuation, spaces, etc.  Output should be 
printed out by expected frequency order (e,
t,
a,
o
,
etc
.
) 
and look something like:
‘e’ 
–
13.27%
‘t’ 
–
9.11%
‘a’ 
–
8.47%
‘o’ 
–
7.32%
...
‘q’ 
–
0.01%
‘z’ 
–
0.00%
Attach a printout of your
code to your submission.
Also
,
attach a printout of your 
code applied to 
THIS HANDOUT (ie: submit a screenshot of your results after 
analyzing the HW1 document).  You may want to copy/paste the contents of this file 
into Notepad to
create 
a
text file you
r program can read.
